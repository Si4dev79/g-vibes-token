        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 15, 2023</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before participating in the G-Vibes Token presale or using our platform. By accessing our website, participating in the token presale, or using any of our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the G-Vibes platform and participation in the G-Vibes Token ("GVIBE") presale. The G-Vibes platform is operated by an anonymous decentralized team ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing our website at <a href="https://gvibestoken.com">gvibestoken.com</a> or any of our associated websites, applications, or services (collectively, the "Platform"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>To participate in the G-Vibes Token presale or use our Platform, you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be at least 18 years of age or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher;</li>
            <li>Have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms;</li>
            <li>Not be a citizen or resident of, or located in, a country that is subject to United Nations, European Union, United Kingdom, or United States sanctions;</li>
            <li>Not be a citizen or resident of, or located in, a jurisdiction where participation in token sales is prohibited by applicable law;</li>
            <li>Not be a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) or on any sanctions lists.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to request proof of identity and residence at any time.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Token Presale</h2>
        <p>3.1. <strong>Nature of Tokens:</strong> GVIBE tokens are utility tokens designed to be used within the G-Vibes ecosystem. They are not intended to be securities, investments, or any form of financial instrument.</p>
        
        <p>3.2. <strong>No Ownership Rights:</strong> Ownership of GVIBE tokens does not grant you ownership, equity, governance rights, or any other form of stake in any legal entity associated with G-Vibes, except as specifically described in these Terms.</p>
        
        <p>3.3. <strong>Presale Participation:</strong> By participating in the presale, you agree to provide accurate and complete information as required for KYC/AML procedures. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel token purchase requests at our sole discretion.</p>
        
        <p>3.4. <strong>Token Distribution:</strong> Tokens will be distributed according to the vesting schedule: 20% at Token Generation Event (TGE) and the remaining 80% released linearly over 6 months. The exact date of the TGE will be announced after the presale concludes.</p>
        
        <p>3.5. <strong>Refund Policy:</strong> All purchases of GVIBE tokens are final and non-refundable unless the presale fails to reach its soft cap, in which case contributions will be returned minus transaction fees.</p>
        
        <p>3.6. <strong>Price Volatility:</strong> The price of GVIBE tokens may be highly volatile. You acknowledge the risks associated with purchasing, holding, and using cryptocurrency tokens.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Risks</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> The regulatory status of tokens, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. Changes in regulations may adversely affect the value or utility of GVIBE tokens.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Risks:</strong> Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and unpredictable. The value of GVIBE tokens may fluctuate significantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Risks:</strong> Blockchain technology is still experimental. There are risks associated with using blockchain technology, including but not limited to, software vulnerabilities, network congestion, and malicious attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Risks:</strong> There is no guarantee that the G-Vibes platform will be successfully developed or launched. The project may face technical, legal, or financial challenges that prevent its completion.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Access:</strong> Loss of private keys or passwords may result in the permanent loss of GVIBE tokens.</li>
        </ul>
